# Project - Ateema GenAI Travel Navigator

## Overview
Ateema AI Tour Guide is an intelligent system that provides personalized travel recommendations and generates engaging videos based on user preferences. The system consists of three main components: a Control Center, a Recommendation System, and a Video Generation module.

## Components

### 1. Control Center
- Receives and processes survey data from users
- Stores data in MongoDB
- Initiates the recommendation process
- Triggers video generation based on recommendations

### 2. Recommendation System
- Uses Ollama (llama3 model) for natural language processing
- Implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach
- Includes grading mechanisms for relevance, bias, and factual accuracy
- Generates personalized travel recommendations

### 3. Video Generation (refer to Video-Gen-Readme.md for further information)
- Converts text to speech using Tortoise TTS
- Generates or downloads relevant images using Stable Diffusion
- Creates animated avatars with SadTalker
- Synchronizes audio, images, and avatars into a video using MoviePy
- Uploads final videos to Google Drive

## Features
- Survey data processing and storage
- AI-powered personalized travel recommendations
- Automated video generation with voiceovers and animations
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Ngrok for secure tunneling
- Google Drive integration for video sharing

## Setup

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.10 or later
- MongoDB instance
- Ngrok account
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment (for video generation)
- Typeform account

### Dependencies
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pymongo flask pyngrok langchain langchain_community langchain-text-splitters langgraph httpx tiktoken gpt4all chromadb transformers sentence_transformers langchain_huggingface torch sadtalker diffusers requests moviepy Pillow google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```
Each component runs as a separate script and communicates with the others to complete a user-driven process. The following instructions will guide you through the setup and operation of the system.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Running the Scripts
You need to start three scripts in separate terminal windows or processes:Control_Center, Recommendation_final, and Video_Generation

#### 2. Generating Public URLs with ngrok
After launching the `Recommendation_system.py` and `video_generation.py` scripts, each will generate a public URL using ngrok.

#### 3. Updating the Control Center with URLs
Once you have the public URLs generated by `ngrok`:
- Copy the URL from the Recommendation System and paste it into the Control Center script.
- Repeat this step for the Video Generation script's URL.

#### 4. Starting the Control Center API
With the URLs in place, the Control Center can now initiate its API processes. A new public URL will be generated by the Control Center.

#### 5. Setting Up Typeform Webhook
- Navigate to the Typeform account's connect section.
- Paste the new URL generated by the Control Center as the webhook connection.

#### 6. System Operation
With everything set up, the system is now live and will be triggered by user input submitted through a Typeform survey.

### Process Workflow
1. **Step 1**: The user submits a survey response on Typeform, which triggers the system.
2. **Step 2**: The Control Center receives the survey data and forwards it to the Recommendation System.
3. **Step 3**: The Recommendation System processes the input and sends a recommendation back to the Control Center.
4. **Step 4**: The Control Center forwards the recommendation to the Video Generation script.
5. **Step 5**: The Video Generation script creates a video and sends back a public link to the Control Center.
6. **Step 6**: The Control Center combines the video link and recommendation and delivers them to the viewer, completing the process.
